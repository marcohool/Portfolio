               <p className="hero--section--description">I'm Marco Boutchelski, a Computer Science graduate who embarked on a seven-year journey into the world of technology, beginning at the age of 14 and culminating in the achievement of First-Class Honors for my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from the University of Surrey.
               </p>
               <p className="hero--section--description">I've had the privilege of gaining practical experience during my time as a summer intern working with the Defence Data Research Centre, where I delved into the world of data resilience, exploring strategies to ensure organisations can maintain uninterrupted operations, even in the face of data-related challenges.
               </p>
               <p className="hero--section--description">Outside the field of technology, I find balance and inspiration through my passion for fitness. Over the years, I've consistently trained in the gym, discovering the discipline of calisthenics and embracing the endurance of long-distance running. These pursuits have taught me invaluable lessons about perseverance, goal-setting, and the importance of a healthy work-life balance. My personal journey in fitness also led me to pursue a level 3 personal training qualification, allowing me to help others achieve their health and fitness goals.</p>
